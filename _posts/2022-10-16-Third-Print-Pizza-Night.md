title: The third Print & Pizza Night.
---
At the print & Pizza night everyone is welcome with an interest in 3D Printing. So are you for example an advanced DIY-builder, owner of a print farm, orientating on buying your first 3d printer or just want to see what is possible? You are welcome at the Print & Pizza night hosted at Pixelbar in Rotterdam. 

Take your prints or even printer with you to show it to others, to ask questions about it or maybe you have a problem. Together with the whole group you get tips and maybe someone can help you solve the problem. But most of all you get to know others with the same interest.

**To get access push the red button on the middle door at the backside of the building and someone will open the door.**
