At the print & Pizza night everyone is welcome with an interest in 3D Printing. So are you, for example an advanced DIY-builder, owner of a print farm, orientating on buying your first 3d printer or just want to see what is possible? You are welcome at the Print & Pizza night hosted at [Bitlair](https://bitlair.nl) in Amersfoort. 

Take your prints or even printer with you to show it to others, to ask questions about it or maybe you have a problem. Together with the whole group you get tips and maybe someone can help you solve the problem. But most of all you get to know others with the same interest.

3D print & pizza evening is hosted at Hackerspace Bitlair, which is located in the Computerweg 20A, 3821 AB Amersfoort.
