title: 9 years Keilewerf 
---
Keilewerf has been around for 9 years and that is celebrated with an open day!
This year is a bit special because of the big fire, but you can still visit Pixelbar at the old location.
We are standing for the last time on the old fundament of Keilewerf 1 at our very own place.
This day is a celebration of renewal, resilience and building an inspiring community.

Learn more about our exciting technology and art projects, workshops and activities. Meet the participants of the Pixelbar Foundation and the entrepreneurs of the Keilewerf.
