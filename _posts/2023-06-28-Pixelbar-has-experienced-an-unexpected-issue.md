title: The disaster that struck
---

On Wednesday 28-06-2023 at around 08:00 AM we got some terrible news from the media, The building that Pixelbar has had its residence in, was on fire. Not "Just" a fire, but a very very big fire. At this moment there is no idea what the damages are, if and how the building got on fire or what this means for us... 

We are devestated and need some time to get the community together to think about our future.

For now, no open evenings at Pixelbar until further announcement!

More info about the fire on the website of [Flashfoto](https://www.flashphoto.nl/nieuws/13281/zeer-grote-uitslaande-brand-in-loods-keileweg-rotterdam.html)

At this moment we have no idea how we are going to proceed, but keep following us to stay up to date on our plans and to help us rebuild!

Small note to all hackers around Rotterdam, Please do not visit the space at this moment since it may be unsafe.

Update 28-06-2023 10:17:00: We opened up a donationlink for rebuilding the space! feel free to donate and be part of Pixelbar Space 3!
