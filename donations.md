As we are still horrified on what happened to our Hackerspace, we are looking into options for a new hackerspace. As we and our members probably lost everything at the space in the fire, we have to start over again.&#x20;

If you want and are able to donate something, you can do this the following way. Its appreciated but it is not an obligation.

The money will be used completely for the rebuild of Pixelbar. In whatever form it will be, like a deposit or increased rent etc.
